# Helecopter Attack
## Description
This is a game where you control a helecopter and your job is to take out an enemy base. You win if you destroy all the buildings and escape safely. You loose if your helecopter gets destroyed

## How to play 
* Use the arrow kets to move the helecopter around
* Hold down the mouse and point to fire the gun
* Use the space bar to drop your bomb
* The gun can be used to gradually destroy a building or instantly kill a soldier 
* The bomb can be used to instantly destroy a building or kill a group of soldiers

## Tips
* Missiles will instantly destroy the helecopter, guns will gradually destroy it
* A soldier will  try to go to a missile pad to launch a missile. If hes not close to one, he will fire his gun at the helecopter
* If a soldier gets close to a missile launch pad, he will activate it and destroy the helecopter
* Buildings will release a certain amount of soldiers over a certain period of time. The more damage the player does, the more the rate will increase

## Compilation
* Make sure you have a C compiler. On Windows, you will probably want to install the MinGW compiler
* Install SDL2. If you're on Windows or Mac, you need to manually install it and put it into the main directory. I recommend you watch a tutorial for that. If you're on linux, you can just install it with the command line
* Run the Make command in the terminal to compile the project. Generally the command is "make," but it might be differant depending on how you have Make set up

## Running the program
*Type "./main.exec" into the terminal to run the program
